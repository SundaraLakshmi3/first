        <h1>back end</h1>
    
    <p>The back-end of the website is the combination of technology and programming that works behind the scenes as the functions or minds of a website. The back end website consists of three parts the server, the application and the daatabase.Backend developers are programmers who work on the core logics of the website, software and application. 
    A back-end developer is someone who builds and mantains the technology needed to power the components which enables the user facing side of the website to exist.  These developers are responsible for creating, maintaining, testing and debbugging the back-end. It deals with core application logic, data, database, servers ,API and etc.

   <h2>Role of back end developer</h2> 
       <p>  The back-end is a website that the user doesn't interact with it, but it is always running in the background to deliver the functionality to the front-end. Back-end plays a crucial role in the web development team by maintaining the data and responding to the services requested by the user.
         The back end is the combination of a database and software written in a server-side language, which is run on web servers, cloud-based servers, or a hybrid of both. In order to make the server, application, and database communicate with each other, back-end developers use languages like PHP, Ruby, Python, Java, and .Net to build an application, and tools like MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server to find, save, or change data and serve it to the user in front end code.

After communicating with a business owner and understanding what their needs and technical requirements are, back-end developers use the aforementioned tools to create web applications with clean, well-documented code. They come up with the most effective and efficient solutions for engineering technology by converting and returning data into front end code a user can interact with, such as filling out a form, creating a profile, shopping online, etc.</p>
<h2>Real Time usage</h2>
<p>A dynamic site is a site that's constantly changing and updated in real-time. To create a dynamic site, a back-end is needed. Most sites are dynamic sites, as opposed to static sites. Facebook, Google Maps and this blog are all considered dynamic sites since their content is constantly changing and updating. 
 A dynamic site requires a database to work properly.  All information is stored in the database, like user profiles or images they've uploaded, or blog posts. Web developers work with programming languages like PHP or .Net, since they need to work with something the database understands. The code they write communicates with the server and then tells the browser what to use from the database.
